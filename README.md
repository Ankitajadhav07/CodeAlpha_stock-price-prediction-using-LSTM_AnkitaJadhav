## Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

### Overview
This repository contains a project focused on predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The project leverages historical stock price data to train an LSTM model for forecasting future prices. The goal is to evaluate the model’s performance and visualize the results to gain insights into stock price trends and prediction accuracy.

### Key Components
- **Data Preparation:** Collected historical stock price data for RELIANCE.NS, TCS.NS, and INFY.NS from Yahoo Finance. Performed preprocessing tasks such as scaling and transformation to prepare the data for LSTM modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted thorough analysis to explore trends, correlations, and daily returns. Created visualizations including rolling statistics, prediction errors, and feature importance plots.
- **Model Development:** Built and trained an LSTM model to predict stock prices. Evaluated the model’s performance using metrics like RMSE and direction accuracy.
- **Visualizations:** Generated various plots to compare predicted and actual prices, assess prediction errors, and analyze daily returns. Included rolling statistics and feature importance plots to enhance understanding of model performance.

### Features
- **Data Visualization:** Includes plots for stock price predictions, prediction errors, daily returns, and rolling statistics.
- **Model Evaluation:** Provides metrics for evaluating model performance, including RMSE and direction accuracy.
- **Feature Importance:** Implements techniques to approximate feature importance for LSTM models.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. Install required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to execute the project.

### Usage
- **Data Loading:** Load historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
- **Model Training:** Train the LSTM model with prepared data.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance and visualize results.
